### Problem Set 1

Mario (less): In C, recreate a right-aligned half-pyramid of hashes. 

Cash: In C, implement a greedy algorithm that finds the minimum number of coins needed to satisfy a given amount. 

### Problem Set 2

Caesar: In C, implement a program to encrypt messages using a Caesar cipher. 
The program takes a 'key' and rotates each letter in the message by that many letters. 

Vigenere: In C, implement a program to encrypt messages using a Vigenere cipher.
This cipher takes a word as the key. Each letter in the message is rotated by corresponding index of the first letter in the key, then the second, and so on. 

### Problem Set 3

Whodunit: Find all the bits in an image of a particular colour and change them to reveal a hidden message

Resize(less): Implement in C a program that resizes a bitmap image by a given value. 

Recover: Implement in C a program that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image. 

### Problem Set 4

Speller: In C, using a file of words (the dictionary), load all the words into a hash table using linked lists. Iterate over words in a text file and check if they are mispelt or not according to the words from the dictionary. Count the total number of words in the dictionary. Unload memory at the end. 

### Problem Set 5

Homepage: Build a simple homepage using HTML and CSS

### Problem Set 6

Hello: Print "Hello World" using Python

Mario(less): Print the hash staircase above using Python

Cash: Implement the cash problem above (greedy algorithm) using Python

Caesar: Implement a Caesar cipher using Python

Bleep: Implement a program that censors messages that contain words that appear on a list of supplied "banned words" using Python. 

### Problem Set 7

Similarities: Implement a program that compares two files for similarities, and display in a website that highlights the similarities across the two files. 

Survey: Implement a web app that enables a user to fill out a form, the results of which are saved to a CSV file on the server, and view a table of all the submissions received. 

These web apps utilise Flask with Python. 

### Problem Set 8

Finance: Implement a website where a user can buy and sell stocks. Data of the user's available money and transaction history is stored in a SQL table. To get a quote for a stock or buy/sell stocks, a request is made to the IEX API to get the current stock value. The website also includes authentication.
